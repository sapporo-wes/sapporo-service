  title: GA4GH Workflow Execution Service API specification extended for the Sapporo
  description: '*Run standard workflows on workflow execution platforms in a platform-agnostic
    way.*


    ## Executive Summary


    The Workflow Execution Service (WES) API provides a standard way for users to
    submit workflow requests to workflow execution systems and monitor their execution.
    This API lets users run a single workflow (currently [**CWL**](https://www.commonwl.org/)
    or [**WDL**](http://www.openwdl.org/) formatted workflows, with other types potentially
    supported in the future) on multiple different platforms, clouds, and environments.


    Key features of the API:


    - Request that a workflow be run.

    - Pass parameters to that workflow (e.g., input files, command-line arguments).

    - Get information about running workflows (e.g., status, errors, output file locations).

    - Cancel a running workflow.


    ## Sapporo-WES Extensions


    `sapporo-wes-2.0.0` extends the original WES API to provide enhanced functionality
    and support for additional features. This document describes the WES API and details
    the specific endpoints, request formats, and responses, aimed at developers of
    WES-compatible services and clients.

      summary: RunWorkflow
      description: 'This endpoint creates a new workflow run and returns a `RunId`
        to monitor its progress.

        The `workflow_attachment` array may be used to upload files that are required
        to execute the workflow, including the primary workflow, tools imported by
        the workflow, other files referenced by the workflow, or files which are part
        of the input.  The implementation should stage these files to a temporary
        directory and execute the workflow from there. These parts must have a Content-Disposition
        header with a "filename" provided for each part.  Filenames may include subdirectories,
        but must not include references to parent directories with ''..'' -- implementations
        should guard against maliciously constructed filenames.

        The `workflow_url` is either an absolute URL to a workflow file that is accessible
        by the WES endpoint, or a relative URL corresponding to one of the files attached
        using `workflow_attachment`.

        The `workflow_params` JSON object specifies input parameters, such as input
        files.  The exact format of the JSON object depends on the conventions of
        the workflow language being used.  Input files should either be absolute URLs,
        or relative URLs corresponding to files uploaded using `workflow_attachment`.  The
        WES endpoint must understand and be able to access URLs supplied in the input.  This
        is implementation specific.

        The `workflow_type` is the type of workflow language and must be "CWL" or
        "WDL" currently (or another alternative  supported by this WES instance).

        The `workflow_type_version` is the version of the workflow language submitted
        and must be one supported by this WES instance.

        The `workflow_engine` is the engine that supports the workflow_type and must
        be supported by this WES instance.

        The `workflow_engine_version` is the version of workflow engine and must be
        supported by this WES instance.
